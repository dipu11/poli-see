<h1>How to read the buildUp privacy policy</h1>

<p>buildUp is a fitness-tracking app and social network. This visualization of the buildUp privacy policy is designed to help you understand how buildUp collects your personal data and how it can use or share your data. We'll give you a quick tutorial here.</p>

<p>When you use buildUp, it will collect different types of data from you. These different types of data are represented in the visualization by small <strong>circles</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Hover</strong> over a circle with your mouse to select it and learn more about how your data can be shared, changed, or used. You can <strong>click</strong> on a circle to keep it selected.</p>

<p>Your data can be shared or changed. This is represented by <strong>arrows</strong> pointing to new circles representing your data after it has been shared or changed. You can <strong>hover</strong> over and <strong>click</strong> arrows to learn more about the specific action they represent.</p>

<p>There are <strong>two rings</strong> in the display. The inner ring, labeled "buildUp," contains circles representing data that is held by buildUp. The outer ring, labeled "Third parties," contains circles representing data that is held by others. </p>

<p>Some data can be <strong>traced back to your identity</strong>. For example, buildUp might store your location with your name. These circles are colored dark blue. Other data is <strong>anonymous</strong> or otherwise not linked to your identity, and these circles are light gray.</p>

<p>Sometimes, buildUp describes what it can do with <strong>all of your data that it collects</strong>. This is represented by circles with a white background that say "ALL DATA."</p>

<p>You have control over some of the data buildUp collects. This control is shown by a <strong>small gear icon</strong> on the circles representing data you can control.</p>
