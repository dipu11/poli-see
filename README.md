# Code for Poli-see: an interactive tool for visualizing privacy policies

We published a paper on this work at WPES '20: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411497.3420221

You can find a working demo of Poli-see on my website: https://wentaoguo.com/projects/poli-see/

To run the tool, open `tool.html` and add a query string of the format `?policy=<policy_json>`, where `<policy_json>` is one of the files under `data/policies`: e.g., `tool.html?policy=care.json`
